only recipes (like OF, but for recipes)
This is my little side project where I am learning basic HTML5 & CSS. Maybe later I will add in learning stuff like JS and other languages that compliment HTML.

**The Vision**

GOD. I AM SO SICK AND TIRED OF FUCKING RECIPE SITES AND THEIR ADS!!!! 
It all began (well this was the final straw anyways) when I looked up a recipe for Stir Fry Sauce on 10/5/21. I went to a site and I was bombarded by a dozen ads, a few of 
which would be right in the middle of the screen and forced me to click the little fucking x a million times. Not only that but there was a thousand word essay, the entirety of 
the United States Bill of Rights, and War & Peace written in 16 world languages before I got to the recipe that had 6 ingredients and 3 steps. Every time I looked up a recipe I 
deal with this shit and think "I should really make my own site". This last time was the last straw.

The problem is I don't know really how to make a site, and don't have the money to get a site running on premium services (or rather my wife won't let me spend money on the millionth
project that I never finish, which fair). With that in mind; this is the perfect chance to start learning how to do this and make use of Githubs free page. So now here we are 
on onlyrecipeshere's github, reading this readme. 

If you have found this readme, visit my github hosted page or send me an email @ willsellon@gmail.com for business inquires.

**The Goal**

The goal(s) is simple; 
1. Learn to code HTML/CSS/JS/+more

   This is the perfect time to try out learning how to do HTML. I have dabbled here and there, but never really finished anything. I took 1 HTML class in my senior year of high
   school, and took part of a HTML course (front end development focused program) on edX that I never finished. I feel as though if I take up a project I am more likely to 
   learning something, assuming I finish this project. I give myself 1 year to see how far I get: On 10/6/2022 we will see how far I have grown. Added to my Google calander! 

2. Make a website that offers an ad free way to share recipes.
 
   I'm here to provide this. This is the end goal! Once this site gets to that point of being good or well done, I may convert this to an actual site; hosted on a real premium 
   service with a domain and everything. Part of this goal will be listed in the next section.
3. ??

   I kinda really only put this goal here for the memeluls. But really I didn't know what to put here. I may add other goals later.
4. Profit

   Profit. Period. But what do I mean by profit?! Well maybe one day I'll find a way to make money off this website. I'll also gain valuable knowledge as I grow my coding ability. 
   And we know that knowing is half the knowing battle. Maybe this knowledge could lead to a job as a web developer, which could lead to more money than what I have now!
   
**Ad-Free?! But How?!**

This is a very important question, isn't it. I realize that the ads are there for a reason; running a website is expensive if it takes a lot to maintain, or the ads are another 
source of income for the person making the blog like website with ads. I should also add, this website won't really be a blog like situation. I'm not going to write a fucking
novel describing my childhood trauma of being forced fed delicious food from my loving parents before every recipe. My plan is to have each recipe page have a basic layout: a
recipe name (the title of the page), a list of ingredients, step by step directions, the source of this recipe if applicable, and maybe some food porn (pictures). 

But how am I going to make money on this?! How will I even support this site?! While I don't expect to make money off this, I have the means to support the website once it's a more finished project. I want to avoid any ads what-so-ever. One day it might get down to running ads to support the site if it gets too much traffic. Though I would want unobtrusive ads and would aim for something like a single ad per page. Maybe one day I could learn how to create an account system and have a "pro version" of the site. If I did this; I would try and not serve ads to anyone but if you pay a cheap premium you get access to additional tools. 


**Why an I even writing this readme**

You don't need a read me for some pathetic site right? Well I guess I can use this as a way to establish my mission and goals for this. If you actually read all all of this, please feel free to reach out to me in the email listed above.

Got any suggestions for my website: please email onlyrecipeshere@gmail.com
There will also be a changenotes file that will be have changes listed in it by day.
